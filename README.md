Bitesize is a quick restaurant finder that takes a minimum of inputs and gives a minimum of outputs so as to cut down on the number of decisions one has to make when one really just wants something to eat. It's best viewed on mobile, but it'll work on desktop, too.

## What problem does it solve?
Hunger tends to exacerbate indecision. Bitesize consciously limits options to make the decision-making process easier.  

## What web APIs did it use?
It uses Yelp's API to provide results, so if you're interested in trying it out locally, sign up for an API key [here](https://www.yelp.com/developers/) and populate an env file with your CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET, USER_TOKEN, and USER_SECRET.

## What technologies did it use?
Bitesize lives on a Node.js Express server, uses a PostgreSQL database to store user preferences, and had its front-end built in React with some help from Material-UI.

## What as the most valuable piece of user feedback you received?
As obvious as it sounds, the expectations users have for mobile pages are different from the ones they have for desktop sites. The feedback helped us tune our interface to be more clear for our users.

## What was the biggest technical challenge you had to overcome?
Learning about what we could and couldn't do with React components was the piece that took the most fiddling. We both came away from the project with positive feelings about React, so all the fiddling was pretty worthwhile.

## What lessons did your team learn as a result of your collaboration?
Communication makes life easier! We talked a lot about the workflow and who was on what piece at a given time, and it made for a very smooth process.
